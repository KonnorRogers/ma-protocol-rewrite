<h2 id="patient-approach">
  Patient Approach:
</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    The presumption is that patients requesting EMS services should not walk to the stretcher or
    ambulance, but should be moved using safe and proper lifts and devices. Specifically the
    condition of patients with cardiac, respiratory, or neurological conditions, and of patients with
    unstable vital signs, can be worsened by exertion, so patient effort in moving to the stretcher and
    ambulance should be minimized. Unique circumstances and deviations from these principles
    must be clearly described in the Patient Care Report (PCR) and the service must have an internal
    performance improvement (PI) mechanism to review each case.
  </li>
  <li>
    DO NOT allow sick or injured patients to walk or otherwise exert themselves. Use safe and proper
    lifts and carries and appropriate devices to extricate patients to the ambulance stretcher.
  </li>
  <li>
    Begin assessment and care at the side of the patient; avoid delay.
  </li>
  <li>
    Bring all necessary equipment to the patient in order to function at your level of certification and
    up to the level of the ambulance service license.
  </li>
  <li>
    Activate air-medical transport early and if applicable to do so.
  </li>
  <li>
    Determine if a valid MOLST order or Comfort Care/DNR Verification form is in place, and act
    accordingly.
  </li>
  <li>
    Initial request for ALS should take place immediately after recognizing severity of symptoms.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="assessment-and-treatment-priorities">
  Assessment and Treatment Priorities:
</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    Determine unresponsiveness, absence of breathing and pulselessness; Initiate high quality CPR
    with minimal interruptions in chest compressions for patients found to be in cardiac arrest and in
    the absence of a MOLST/CC/DNR.
  </li>
  <li>
    Determine patient’s hemodynamic stability, symptoms, level of consciousness, ABCs, vital signs.
  </li>
  <li>
    Maintain an open airway and assist ventilations as needed.
  </li>
  <li>
    Apply the cardiac monitor and obtain a 12-lead ECG tracing as soon as possible when clinically
    appropriate and within your scope of practice.
  </li>
  <li>
    Administer supplemental oxygen using the appropriate delivery device, if indicated.
  </li>
  <li>
    Within your scope of practice, obtain peripheral access via intravenous (IV) or intraosseous (IO)
    on all patients exhibiting signs and symptoms consistent with shock or who are hemodynamically
    compromised, or have the potential to become compromised. For pediatric patients, administer a
    20mL/kg fluid bolus if applicable.
  </li>
  <li>
    When obtaining IO access in patients able to perceive pain, in adults, administer Lidocaine 40mg
    over two minutes, followed by a 10mL fluid bolus over five seconds. In pediatrics, 1mg/kg to a
    maximum of 20mg.
  </li>
  <li>
    Patients who may be in need of medications for conditions such as but not limited to nausea or
    pain should also have IV access established if possible to do so.
    In a critical patient with no other vascular access, if trained to do so and with concurrent on-line
  medical control order, Paramedics may access a Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter (PICC)
    line (not any other central access) in order to administer medications.
  </li>
  <li>
    Consider the use of advanced airway interventions as appropriate and if trained to do so.
  </li>
  <li>
    Ventilation rates are to be titrated to goal ETCO2 recommendations.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use quantitative, recordable waveform capnography for all patients with advanced airway
    interventions and consider its use with all respiratory compromised conditions.
  </li>
  <li>
    The capnography waveform must be recorded on all intubated patients and clinically significant
    data attached to the patient care report for the receiving facility. In patients who are not in cardiac
    arrest, all efforts should be made to avoid end-tidal carbon dioxide levels that have been shown to
    be detrimental and to ensure quality ventilation and oxygenation. In general this means that
    capno-ETCO2 values should be kept between 35-40 mm Hg in these patients; specific exceptions
    should be discussed with online medical control.
  </li>
  <li>
    At a minimum, monitor and document vital signs every 15 minutes on stable patients and every 5
    minutes for patients with critical conditions.
  </li>
  <li>
    Obtain a thorough assessment (O-P-Q-R-S-T) related to the event.
  </li>
  <li>
    Obtain a complete medical history (S-A-M-P-L-E).
  </li>
  <li>
    Obtain venous blood samples according to the receiving hospital policies.
  </li>
  <li>
    Obtain additional field diagnostic testing when clinically indicated, and if available; (not limited to)
    blood glucose, pulse oximetry, temperature, carbon monoxide, stroke scale.
  </li>
  <li>
    Administer medications in accordance with the specific patient condition and scope of practice.
  </li>
  <li>
    Contact on-line Medical Control for all procedures outside the provisions of standing orders, which
    may include repeat doses of medications within the standing orders.
  </li>
  <li>
    Follow service or regional policies for all radio or communication failures.
  </li>
  <li>
    If indicated, contact the receiving hospital to provide a clear and concise report on the patient’s
    condition, all interventions, findings, and estimated time of arrival to the receiving department.
  </li>
  <li>
    Continually reassess all patients, especially after any interventions and/or medication
    administration.
  </li>
  <li>
    If no palpable, distal pulse is present following suspected extremity fracture, position injured
    extremity in correct anatomic position, and apply gentle traction along the axis of the extremity
    distal to the injury until the distal pulse is palpable and immobilize in place. Note: This does not
    apply to dislocations.
  </li>
  <li>
    EMS crews should not begin or administer interventions that would require medical assessment if
    a patient is being brought to an environment where formal medical assessment will not be
    provided; for example, giving IV narcotics to a patient who is about to be left at home.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="stretcher-operations">
  Ambulance Stretcher Operations:
</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    Operate the ambulance stretcher in accordance with your service training and manufacturer’s
    specifications at all times.
  </li>
  <li>
    When moving a patient on the ambulance stretcher, adjust the height of the ambulance stretcher
    from the “load position” to a safe position for travel.
  </li>
  <li>
    All EMTs moving the patient must keep both hands on the ambulance cot when elevated or in
    motion. Properly secure all patients using the required straps, including the over-the-shoulder
    harness, hip and leg restraining straps.
  </li>
  <li>
    If patient care requires the removal of any of the restraining straps, re-secure them as soon as
    practical to do so.
  </li>
  <li>
    Pediatric patients are to be transported in a properly secured child transport device/seat if spinal
    injury is not suspected <Link to="/pediatric-transport-7.4">(See 7.4 Pediatric Transport for more)</Link>.
  </li>
</ul>
