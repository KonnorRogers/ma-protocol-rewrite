      If utilizing a BVM, monitor quantitative waveform capnography throughout
      resuscitation to assess CPR quality and to monitor for signs of return of

    <li>
      Provide manual defibrillation as indicated after each 2 minute cycle
    </li>
    <li>After 4 cycles (8 minutes):</li>

        Consider endotracheal intubation or use an alternative airway without

        If authorized and trained by AHMD, Paramedics may use mechanical
        ventilators in rate control mode with the following settings:
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>Rate of 8-12 breaths per minute</li>
        <li>Tidal volume 300-500mL</li>
        <li>
          Start at FiO2 1.0 (100%) then titrate to maintain SpO2 > 94% (90% for
          COPD patients)
        </li>
        <li>Relief pressure 45-60 cmH2O</li>
        <li>
          Paramedics may utilize mechanical ventilator following the initiation
          of respiratory component at least 8 minutes after start of
          resuscitation even if ROSC has occurred.

  PEARLS:
  <ul>
    <li>
      It is expected, unless special circumstances are present, initial 8
      minutes of resuscitation will be performed on scene.
    </li>
    <li>
      Early CPR and defibrillation are the most effective therapies for cardiac
      arrest care.
    </li>
    <li>
      Minimize interruptions in chest compression, as pauses rapidly return the
      blood pressure to zero and stop perfusion to the heart and brain.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>
        Recognizing the goal of immediate uninterrupted chest compressions,
        consider delaying application of mechanical CPR devices until after the
        first four cycles (8 minutes). If applied during the first 4 cycles, the
        goal is to limit interruptions. Mechanical devices should only be used by
        services that are practiced and skilled at their application.
      </strong>
    </li>
    <li>Switch compressors at least every two minutes to minimize fatigue.</li>
    <li>
      Perform chest compressions while defibrillator is charging and resume
      compressions immediately after the shock is delivered.
    </li>
  </ul>
