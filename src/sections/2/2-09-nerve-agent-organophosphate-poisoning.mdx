<Caution id="caution-1">
  Do not administer an adult dose to a child &lt;50kg.
</Caution>

<Caution id="caution-2">
  Dermal absorption of nerve agents may lead to delayed symptom
  onset up to 18 hours after exposure. Initial symptoms/signs may only be
  local such as localized fasiculations and sweating.
</Caution>

  <strong>PROCEDURES FOR SELF-CARE AND CARE OF AUTHORIZED PUBLIC EMPLOYEES
  OR FIRST RESPONDERS</strong>
  <ol style="text-align: left;">
    <li>Remove self or fellow authorized public employee from area if possible.</li>
    <li>Assess degree of symptoms: Mild, Moderate or Severe.</li>
    <li>
      Administer 1 to 3 auto-injector kits IM (each kit with atropine 2mg IM and pralidoxime chloride
      600mg IM) as guided by degree of symptoms.

    <li>
      Seek additional medical support for further monitoring and transport of anyone receiving therapy.

      Disrobing will significantly enhance the decontamination process. Perform decontamination, and

<Note id="note-2" alignment="left">
  Mark I kits and Duodote are not approved for pediatric use, however, they should be used as
  initial therapy in circumstances for children with severe life-threatening nerve agent toxicity when IV
  therapy is not available. This assumes 0.8 inch needle insertion depth.

  <br /><br />

  Potential high dose of atropine and pralidoxime for age/weight. However, these numbers are
  within the general guidelines recommended for the first 60-90 minutes of therapy after a severe
  exposure.

  <br /><br />

  Administer injection in large muscle mass. Avoid deltoid. Suggest using thigh.
