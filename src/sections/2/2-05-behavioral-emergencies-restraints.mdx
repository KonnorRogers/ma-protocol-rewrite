      Adults (or emancipated minors as defined in A/R 5-610) who are

      effects of their actions and/or decisions have the right to refuse
      treatment and/or transport. Do not restraint these individuals.

    </li>
    <li>
      Never restrain a patient in a prone position or use equipment that forms a "sandwich" around the patient.
    </li>
    <li>
      Have a minimum of four (4) trained personnnel coordinate the restraint effort and consider involving parents if patient is a child.
