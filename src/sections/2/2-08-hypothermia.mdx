    <li>Avoid Rough Movement and Prevent Further Heat Loss:</li>
    <li>Insulate from the ground and shield from wind/water</li>
    <li>Move to a warm environment as soon as practical</li>
    <li>Remove any wet clothing</li>
    <li>Cover with warm blankets, particularly the head</li>
    <li>
      Determine patient’s hemodynamic status: Assess pulse and respiratory rates
      for a period of 60 seconds to determine pulselessness or profound asystole, for
      which CPR would be required.
    </li>
    <li>
      If patient is in cardiopulmonary arrest, refer to:
      <ul>
        3.4A Cardiac Arrest - Asystole/Pulseless Electrical Activity
        3.4P Cardiac Arrest - Asystole/Pulseless Electrical Activity
        3.5A Cardiac Arrest - Ventricular Fibrillation/Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia.
        3.5P Cardiac Arrest - Ventricular Fibrillation/Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia.
      </ul>
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Initiate CPR and administer oxygen using appropriate oxygen delivery
        device, as clinically indicated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use AED according to the ECC guidelines or as otherwise noted in these
        Protocols and other advisories.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>
      Whenever possible, use warmed, humidified oxygen (104°F – 107°F, 40°C –
      42°C) by non-rebreather mask, during resuscitation procedures for hypothermic
      patients.
    </li>
    <li>
      CAUTION: Do NOT administer anything orally if patient does not have a
      reasonable level of consciousness and normal gag reflex.
    </li>
    <li>
      Manage hypoglycemia and narcotic overdose per protocol.
    </li>
  </ul>

<EMTLevel level="advanced">
  Warm IV Fluids should be used.

<EMTLevel level="paramedic">
  If pulse and breathing are absent, treat per Cardiac Arrest Protocols.
