    IDENTIFICATION OF POSSIBLE SEPTIC SHOCK
  </strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Suspected infection – YES</li>
    <li>Evidence of sepsis criteria - YES (2 or more):</li>

      <ul>
        <li>Temperature less than 96.8° F or greater than 100.4° F</li>
        <li>
          Heart Rate greater than normal limit for age (heart rate may not be elevated in septic
          hypothermic patients) AND at least one of the following indications of altered organ function
        </li>
        <li>Altered mental status (decreased, irritable, confused)</li>
        <li>Capillary refill time &lt; 1 second(flash) or &gt; 3 seconds</li>
        <li>Mottled cool extremities</li>
        <li>Decreased urine output</li>

  NOTE: Consider early consultation with Medical Control for suspected pediatric septic
  shock patients.

      IV/IO fluids should be titrated to attain normal capillary refill, peripheral
      pulses, and level of consciousness.

      Administer fluid boluses of 20 mL/kg of 0.9% NaCl by syringe push method:
    </li>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Reassess patient immediately after completion of bolus and repeat 2
        times (max 60 mL/kg) if inadequate response to boluses.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <strong>
    NOTE: Reassessment of patient after boluses should include assessment of
    improving clinical signs and signs of volume overload (rales, increased work
    of breathing, or increased oxygen requirements).

      If there is no response after 3 fluid boluses, contact Medical Control to

        Epinephrine infusion: 0.1 mcg/kg/min IV/IO, titrate to maintain

    <li>
      To stabilize blood pressure-titrate infusions to maintain perfusion.

      Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response due to infection.
      Frequent causes of septic shock include urinary, respiratory, or
      gastrointestinal infections and complications from catheters and
      feeding tubes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Patient who are immuno-compromised are also susceptible to sepsis.
    </li>
    <li>
      Septic shock has a high mortality and is one of the leading causes of pediatric deaths.
    </li>
    <li>
      Aggressive IV therapy and early antibiotic significantly reduce death.
