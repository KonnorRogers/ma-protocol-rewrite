      Keep environment calm by reducing stimuli (may need to ask family/friends to

       them to calm down before attempting to discuss options again.
    </li>
    <li>
      Provide reassurance by acknowledging the crisis and validating the patient’s
       feelings and concerns; use positive feedback, not minimization.
    </li>
    <li>
      Determine risk to self and others (“Are you thinking about hurting/killing yourself
       or others?”).
    </li>
    <li>
      Encourage patient to cooperatively accept transport to the hospital for a
       psychiatric evaluation and treatment.
    </li>
    <li>

    <li>
      Ask law enforcement or Online Medical Control to complete a MDMH Section 12
