    Etiology of Shock
  </strong>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Cardiogenic Shock: History of cardiac surgery, rhythm disturbances, or
      post cardiac arrest. Assess for acute MI and pulmonary edema.
      <ul>
        <li>
          Signs & Symptoms of cardiogenic shock: chest pain, shortness of breath, crackles, JVD, hypotension, tachycardia, diaphoresis.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      Distributive Shock: Anaphylaxis (see 2.2 Allergic
      Reaction/Anaphylaxis), neurogenic shock, sepsis. Assess for fever
      and signs of infection.

      <ul>
        <li>
          Signs & Symptoms of neurogenic shock: sensory and/or motor loss, hypotension, bradycardia versus
          normal heart-rate, warm, dry skin.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      Hypovolemic Shock: Dehydration, volume loss, or hemorrhagic shock.
      <ul>
        <li>
          Signs & Symptoms of hypovolemic shock: tachycardia,
          tachypnea, hypotension, diaphoresis, cool skin, pallor, flat
          neck veins.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      Obstructive Shock: Consider tension pneumothorax, pulmonary embolism, and cardiac tamponade.
      <ul>
        <li>
          Signs and symptoms of tension pneumothorax: asymmetric or
          absent unilateral breath sounds, respiratory distress or
          hypoxia, signs of shock including tachycardia and hypotension,
          JVD, possible tracheal deviation above the sternal notch (late
          sign).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

<Note id="note-3" alignment="left">

    For patients with uncontrolled hemorrhagic or penetrating torso injuries:
  </strong>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Restrict IV fluids. Delaying aggressive fluid resuscitation
      until operative intervention may improve the outcome.
    </li>
    <li>
      Patients should be reassessed frequently, with special attention
      given to the lung examination to ensure volume overload does not
      occur.
    </li>
    <li>
      Several mechanisms for worse outcomes associated with IV fluid
      administration have been suggested, including dislodgement of clot
      formation, dilution of clotting factors, and acceleration of
      hemorrhage caused by elevated blood pressure.
