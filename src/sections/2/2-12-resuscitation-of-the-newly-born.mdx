        Maintain an open airway and suction the mouth, then nose. If meconium (brown
        stained fluid) is present, suction the hypopharynx only if the infant is not vigorous

<Note id="note-1" alignment="left">
  The newly born should be evaluated for central cyanosis. Peripheral
  cyanosis is common and may not be a reflection of inadequate
  oxygenation. If central cyanosis is present in a breathing newborn
  during stabilization, early administration of 100% oxygen is important
  while the newborn is being assessed for need of additional 
  resuscitative measures.
