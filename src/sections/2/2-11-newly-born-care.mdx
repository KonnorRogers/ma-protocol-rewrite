          1.0 Routine Patient Care—dry, warm, position, stimulate.
        </li>
        <li>
          For newly born requiring resuscitation, see 2.12 Resuscitation of the Newly
          Born.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reassess airway by positioning and clearing secretions (only if needed):
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Place the newly born on back or side with head in a neutral or slightly
            extended position.
          </li>
          <li>
            Routine suctioning is discouraged even in the presence of meconium-stained
            amniotic fluid. Suction oropharynx then nares only if the patient exhibits
            respiratory depression and/or obstruction, see 2.12 Resuscitation of the
            Newly Born.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Clamp and cut the umbilical cord:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>After initial assessment and after the cord stops pulsating.</li>
          <li>Leave a minimum of 6 inches of cord.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Prevent heat loss by rapidly drying and warming:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Remove wet linen, wrap newly born in blankets or silver swaddler (preferred)
            and cover newly born’s head.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Assess breathing by providing tactile stimulation:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Flick soles of feet and/or rub the newly born’s back.</li>
          <li>
            If newly born is apneic or has gasping respirations, nasal flaring, or grunting,
            proceed t2.12 Resuscitation of the Newly Born.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Assess circulation, heart rate, and skin color:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Evaluate heart rate by one of several methods:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Auscultate apical beat with a stethoscope.</li>
            <li>Palpate the pulse by lightly grasping the base of the umbilical cord.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If the pulse is &lt; 100 bpm and not increasing, proceed to 2.12 Resuscitation of
            the Newly Born. Assess skin color; examine trunk and face; and mucus
            membranes.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          Record APGAR score at 1 minute and 5 minutes

  <strong>PEARLS:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Newly born are prone to hypothermia which may lead to hypoglycemia, hypoxia and lethargy.
      Aggressive warming techniques should be initiated including drying, swaddling, and warm blankets
      covering body and head.
    </li>
    <li>
      Raise temperature in ambulance patient compartment.
    </li>
  </ul>
