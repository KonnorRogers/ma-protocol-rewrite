      If patient is over 6 months age and under 25kg, administer epinephrine 0.15mg
      via auto-injector or IM.
    </li>

      If body weight is over 25 kg, administer epinephrine
      0.3mg via auto-injector or IM.

      When administering IM, EMTs may do so in

<strong>
  Criteria for epinephrine administration:
</strong>

<ul>
  <li>
    Age greater than or equal to 6 months
  </li>
  <li>
    Known history of asthma or reactive airway disease or bronchospasm or
    bronchodilators prescribed AND
  </li>
  <li>
    Patient in respiratory arrest or approaching respiratory arrest(requiring BVM) -
    include:
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Diminished or absent breath sounds <strong>AND</strong>
    </li>
    <li>Oxygen saturation less than 91% despite supplemental oxygen or unmeasurable.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
</EMTLevel>

<EMTLevel level="advanced">
  <ul>
    <li>
      If the condition is not improving with administration of supplemental oxygen,
      consider the following:
    </li>
    <li>
      Albuterol sulfate 1.25 mg with ipratropium bromide, 250 mcg via nebulizer if
      less than 2 years of age.
    </li>
    <li>
      Albuterol sulfate 2.5-3 mg with ipratropium bromide, 500 mcg via nebulizer if
      age 2 years or greater.
    </li>
    <li>
      A second dose of albuterol, with or without ipratropium bromide, may be
      administered as necessary.
    </li>
  </ul>

<strong>Note:</strong> a multi-dose inhaler may be used to give albuterol or ipratropium (instead of
nebulizer) if infection control is an issue (e.g., influenza-like-illness).

<Caution id="caution-1">
  Epinephrine for anaphylaxis must be administered by Auto-Injector or IM if
  trained and authorized to do so in accordance with:

</Caution>

<Caution id="caution-2">
  For patients under 12 years old, the airway is in most cases best managed with a BVM or SGA.
  <div>
    In some cases, intubation may be preferred. This is at the discretion of the treating paramedic.

    <strong>Mild distress </strong>in children is evidenced by minor wheezing and good air entry.
  </div>

  <div style="margin: 1.25rem 0">
    <strong>Severe distress</strong> in children is evidenced by poor air entry, extreme use of accessory muscles,
    nasal flaring, grunting, cyanosis and/or altered mental status (weak cry, somnolence, poor
    responsiveness). <strong>REMEMBER:</strong> Severe bronchospasm may present without wheezes, if there is
    minimal air movement.
  </div>

  <div>
    <strong>Respiratory Distress</strong> is defined as inadequate breathing in terms of rate, rhythm, quality and/or
    depth of breathing. Children who are breathing too fast or slow, or in an abnormal pattern or
    manner, may not be receiving enough oxygen to support bodily functions and may allow an
    increase in carbon dioxide to dangerous levels. Cyanosis is usually a late sign and requires
    immediate treatment.
